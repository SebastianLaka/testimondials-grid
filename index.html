                    I've been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience
                    here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly
                    thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most gruelinmg - time of my life. Since completing
                    the course. I've succesfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. "</p>
